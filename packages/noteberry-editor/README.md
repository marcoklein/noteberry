# Noteberry Editor

A block-based editor for linked markdown notes with VIM support.

## Local Development

This repository can use a local installation from the codemirror block editor extension.
For this you have to clone the repository.

To install the latest version from the local repository run

```sh
install:codemirror-block-editor
```

This builds new artifacts and copies the _dist_ folder into the `src/codemirror-block-editor` folder.
